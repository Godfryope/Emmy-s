Our cooperation with the industry leaders and access to the newest and most advanced technologies in the industry, quickly made us one of the world‘s leading mining services.</p>

						      	<p>Bitcoptions has been in development since 2017, but predicting a deep correction of Bitcoin and the main cryptocurrencies, we decided to wait out the fall. Then, in the second half of 2018, the price for one ASIC miner reached 5,200 USD. It soon became clear that with such prices, mining will very soon cease to be such a liquid business. We waited and worked for a whole year until finally the cryptocurrency market stabilized. Now mining cryptocurrency is still a super-profitable and very stable field, which is why we are entering this market with new forces and ideas.</p>

We sincerely believe that the trend will continue, but the market is constantly undergoing changes and it is possible that this opinion will be revised by adding mining equipment for altcoins.</p>
						      	<p>Of course, you can do it that way! However, then you will have to face a rather long list of additional "narrow" places, where both your profit and your initial possessions may be vulnerable, and nobody would like that. Here is a brief list of the main nuances that you need to keep in mind when you make an independent purchase, placement and maintenance of mining facilities:</p>
						      	<p>- Self-purchase of equipment is not always easy and safe. First of all, you need to choose a retailer. Pay attention to the constituent documents of the retailer, if you make this operation. It would be much safer to make purchases from a trusted retailer with a 2+ year experience and a feedback base and regular customers.</p>
						      	<p>- Often people have been slipped with used / miners or other models of miners. Before you pay for the equipment, carefully check the logs, as well as run your ASIK for at least 30 minutes, to make sure that it is able to consistently maintain the increased power. Also quite often, the suppliers, hoping for the client's illegibility, sell him another model of the miner. The differences between the same S9 (14.5) and S9i and S9 (13.5 TH / s) may not always be obvious, and an inexperienced user who, without noticing them, may find himself the owner of a knowingly unprofitable machine that has long been removed from the warranty.</p>
						      	<p> Shipping cost + customs expenses + VAT + commissions outbid. All this will affect the future payback of the project. That's why cloud mining was chosen - everything is already included in the price.</p>
