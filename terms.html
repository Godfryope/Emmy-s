You acknowledge that this may reduce your allocated Services and the Customer Portion which is distributed to you.</dt><br>
		<dt><b>14.5.</b> <u>Regulation</u>. We have the right to redeem the current active mining contracts at the current one-time allocation price in order to avoid disputes in connection with entry into force of the government regulation (if any) of the Services with 7 days notice via internal email.</dt><br>
		</dl>
		<li>HOW DO I RESOLVE DISPUTES ABOUT THE SERVICES?</li>
		<dl>
		<dt><b>15.1.</b> <u>General</u>. YOU AND WE AGREE TO RESOLVE DISPUTES ARISING UNDER, CONCERNING, OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT (INCLUDING ANY SERVICES), ITS INTERPRETATION, ITS VALIDITY (INCLUDING ANY CLAIM THAT ALL OR ANY PART OF THIS AGREEMENT IS VOID OR VOIDABLE), ITS TERMINATION, OR ITS SUBJECT MATTER, THE MARKETING OR PURCHASE OF THE SERVICE OR ANY USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE SERVICE, WHETHER THEY ARE WITH US OR ANY OF OUR SUPPLIERS (TO THE EXTENT NOT WAIVED, AS SET FORTH ABOVE) ONLY BY MANDATORY, FINAL, BINDING ARBITRATION. THAT MEANS YOU ARE WAIVING THE RIGHT TO A TRIAL BY JUDGE OR JURY, SINCE THERE IS NONE IN ARBITRATION. IN ARBITRATION, THE PROCEDURES MAY BE DIFFERENT THAN IN COURT, BUT AN ARBITRATOR CAN AWARD YOU THE SAME DAMAGES AND RELIEF, AND MUST HONOR THE SAME TERMS IN THIS AGREEMENT, AS A COURT WOULD. YOU AGREE THAT IN SOME CASES, THE LAW PERMITS THE PREVAILING PARTY TO BE REIMBURSED FOR ITS ATTORNEYS FEES, AND THE SAME APPLIES TO DISPUTES THAT YOU RAISE IN ARBITRATION.</dt><br>
		<dt><b>15.2.</b> <u>Arbitration of Disputes</u>. Any controversy, claim, or dispute (“Dispute”) arising under, concerning, or relating to this Agreement (including any Services), its interpretation, its validity (including any claim that all or any part of this Agreement is void or voidable), its termination, or its subject matter, the marketing or purchase of the Service or any use or inability to use the Service, whether the Dispute is with us or any or any Supplier (to the extent not waived, as set forth above), whether the Dispute is for breach of contract, tort, or any other matter can only be resolved or adjudicated only by mandatory, final, binding arbitration.</dt><br>
		<dt><b>15.3.</b> <u>Raising a Dispute</u>. To raise a Dispute, you must give us a notice of the Dispute by sending an e-mail to <a href="mailto:info@bitcoptions.com">info@bitcoptions.com</a> with the words “RAISING A DISPUTE” in the subject line), along with a written description of your Dispute, including any documents and information that you believe will help us to understand your Dispute, and your requested resolution. In order to discuss the Dispute with you, you permit us (or the Disputed party) to contact you by phone, text message, email or physical mail through any and all addresses or phone numbers that you have provided. You must send us notice of any Dispute within 30 days of your discovering the act or omission that gave rise to your Dispute. If you do not so notify us, then you lose your right to raise the Dispute.  </dt><br>
		<dt><b>15.4.</b> <u>Resolution Offer</u>. Within the first 30 days after you submitted your Dispute, we will have the right, but no obligation, to provide you with a proposed resolution of the Dispute (hereinafter referred to as “the Offer”). If you are unsatisfied with the Offer, you must reject the Offer by giving us the notification within 14 days from the date of the Offer. If you do not reject the Offer within the 14-day period, you will be deemed to have accepted it and forfeit your right to raise the Dispute. If we do not make the Offer within 30 days after you submitted your Dispute or if you reject an Offer as set forth above, either you or we may commence the arbitration of the Dispute as set forth below.</dt><br>
		<dt><b>15.5.</b> <u>Place and Language</u>. The arbitration proceeding shall be conducted in the English language, in the Republic of Ireland. We shall choose the arbitration service to be used for the Dispute.</dt><br>
		<dt><b>15.6.</b> <u>Award</u>. Any award of the arbitrator shall be in writing and shall state the reasons for the award. Judgment upon the award may be entered in any court having competent jurisdiction. The decision of the arbitrator must be based upon this Agreement and applicable Law. The decision of the arbitrator is final and binding except for fraud, misconduct, or errors of law, and judgment upon the decision rendered may be entered in any court having jurisdiction.</dt><br>
		<dt><b>15.7.</b> <u>Waiver of Rights</u></dt><br>
		<dt>IT IS IMPORTANT THAT YOU HAVE READ THIS ARBITRATION CLAUSE. IT PROVIDES THAT YOU MAY BE REQUIRED TO SETTLE ANY CLAIM OR DISPUTE THROUGH ARBITRATION, EVEN IF YOU WOULD PREFER TO LITIGATE THE CLAIM IN COURT. YOU GIVE UP THE RIGHTS YOU MIGHT HAVE TO LITIGATE SUCH CLAIMS BEFORE A JURY, TO ENGAGE IN DISCOVERY, AND TO PARTICIPATE IN A CLASS ACTION OR SIMILAR PROCEEDING. OTHER RIGHTS THAT YOU WOULD HAVE IF YOU WENT TO COURT, SUCH AS THE RIGHT TO APPEAL THE ARBITRATOR'S AWARD, MIGHT NOT BE AVAILABLE IN ARBITRATION OR MIGHT BE MORE LIMITED. YOU SHOULD CONSULT THE LEGAL COUNSEL TO DETERMINE WHETHER THIS ARBITRATION CLAUSE IS APPROPRIATE FOR YOU OR NOT.</dt><br>
		<dt>YOU UNDERSTAND AND AGREE THAT ANY DISPUTE WILL BE RESOLVED BY BINDING ARBITRATION. ARBITRATION REPLACES THE RIGHT TO GO TO COURT, INCLUDING THE RIGHT TO HAVE A JURY, TO ENGAGE IN DISCOVERY (EXCEPT AS MAY BE PROVIDED IN THE ARBITRATION RULES), AND TO PARTICIPATE IN A CLASS ACTION OR SIMILAR PROCEEDING. IN ARBITRATION, A DISPUTE IS RESOLVED BY AN ARBITRATOR INSTEAD OF A JUDGE OR JURY. ARBITRATION PROCEDURES ARE SIMPLER AND MORE LIMITED THAN COURT PROCEDURES. YOU ALSO AGREE ANY ARBITRATION WILL BE LIMITED TO THE DISPUTE BETWEEN YOU AND THE COMPANY AND WILL NOT BE PART OF A CLASS-WIDE OR CONSOLIDATED ARBITRATION PROCEEDING.</dt><br>
		<dt><b>15.8.</b> <u>NO CLASS ACTIONS</u>. EVEN IF THE APPLICABLE LAW, OR THE ARBITRATOR OTHERWISE PERMITS CLASS ACTIONS OR CLASS ARBITRATIONS, THE DISPUTE RESOLUTION PROCEDURE SPECIFIED HERE APPLIES AND YOU WAIVE ANY RIGHT TO PURSUE DISPUTES ON A CLASSWIDE BASIS – THAT IS – TO EITHER JOIN A CLAIM WITH THE CLAIM OF ANY OTHER PERSON OR ENTITY, OR ASSERT A CLAIM IN A REPRESENTATIVE CAPACITY ON BEHALF OF ANYONE ELSE IN ANY LAWSUIT, ARBITRATION OR OTHER PROCEEDING.</dt><br>

		</dl>
		<li>OTHER IMPORTANT TERMS</li>
		<dl>
		<dt><b>16.1.</b> <u>Governing Law</u>. Irish law shall govern any disputes relating to the Service or these Terms, notwithstanding the Irish conflicts of laws' rules or any other jurisdiction.</dt><br>
		<dt><b>16.2.</b> <u>Entire Agreement</u>. This Agreement (including any Services) constitutes the entire agreement between you and us. You acknowledge that you have not relied on any statement, promise or representation made or given by or on behalf of us which is not set out in this Agreement.</dt><br>
		<dt><b>16.3.</b> <u>Our Assignment</u>. We may transfer or assign our rights and obligations under this Agreement or a Service to another entity, but this will not affect your rights or our obligations under this Agreement or the terms of the Service. We will endeavor to notify you in writing if this happens.</dt><br>
		<dt><b>16.4.</b> <u>Your Assignment.</u> A Service is between you and us, and you may not assign, transfer, sublease, encumber or subject to any security interest a Service without written authorization from us. Any attempted assignment in violation of this Agreement will be void and of no effect.</dt><br>
		<dt><b>16.5.</b> <u>Third Party Beneficiaries</u>. No other person, except you, shall have any rights to enforce this Agreement or a Service, whether under the Contracts or otherwise.</dt><br>
		<dt><b>16.6.</b> <u>Severability</u>. If any provision of this Agreement is held to be invalid or unenforceable, including without limitation anything regarding the arbitration process, such provision will be struck from this Agreement only to the extent it is invalid or unenforceable. Unless otherwise provided, all other terms of this Agreement will remain in full force and effect.</dt><br>
		<dt><b>16.7.</b> <u>Waiver</u>. If we fail to insist that you perform any of your obligations under this Agreement, or if we do not enforce our rights against you, or if we delay in doing so, that will not mean that we have waived our rights against you and will not mean that you do not have to comply with those obligations. If we do waive a default by you, we will only do so in writing, and that will not mean that we will automatically waive any later default by you.</dt><br>
		<dt><b>16.8.</b> <u>Conflict</u>. If there is a conflict between this Agreement and something stated by any Other Entity, whether before or after you enter into this Agreement, the terms of this Agreement will prevail.</dt><br>
		<dt><b>16.9.</b> <u>Survival</u>. Any terms of this Agreement which by their nature should survive will survive the termination of this Agreement.</dt><br>
